/**
 * Interface for a geometric two-dimensional shape, such as a point, rectangle,
 * circle or triangle.
 *
 * This interface gives access to general properties of all shapes, particular
 * properties of a specific kind of shape are access through corresponding
 * interfaces.
 *
 * The shapes are independent of the coordinate system â€“ they have no "position"
 * or "rotation" or other attributes that would place them in 2D space.
 *
 * Note that shapes such as a 2x4 rectangle and a 4x2 rectangle are distinct,
 * even though they may look the same if they are later placed in a coordinate
 * system and rotated.
